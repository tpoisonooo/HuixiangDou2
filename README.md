# HuixiangDou2: A Robustly Optimized GraphRAG Approach

We integrated 4 open-source projects (HuixiangDou, KAG, LightRAG, and DB-GPT, totaling 18k lines of code) and conducted comparative experiments on a test set where the performance of `Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct` was subpar. The results showed an improvement from a baseline score of 0.6 to ~0.75.

We ultimately developed a GraphRAG implementation whose performance has been recognized by domain experts. [Here is the report]([./docs/](https://github.com/tpoisonooo/HuixiangDou2/blob/main/docs/huixiangdou2_github.pdf)).

## Version Description

Compared to [HuixiangDou1](https://github.com/internlm/huixiangdou), this repo improves accuracy and `async` refactor:
1. **Graph Schema**. Dense retrieval is only for querying similar entities and relationships.
2. Ported/merged multiple open-source implementations, with code differences of nearly 10k lines:
   - **Data**. Organized a set of real domain knowledge that LLM has not fully seen for testing (gpt4o-0613 accuracy < 0.6)
   - **Ablation**. Confirmed the impact of different stages and parameters on accuracy
   - **Improvement**. As shown below.

      </div>
     
3. API remains compatible

> **Note**: The impact of open-source on different fields/industries varies. We can only provide code implementation and test conclusions, and the test data cannot be provided.
