HuixiangDou2 is an implementation of KG-LLM Retrieval.

Compared to [HuixiangDou1](https://github.com/internlm/huixiangdou), it improves accuracy and `async` refactor:
1. **Graph Schema**. Dense retrieval is only for querying similar entities and relationships.
2. Ported/merged multiple open-source implementations, with code differences of nearly 10k lines:
   - **Data**. Organized a set of real domain knowledge that LLM has not fully seen for testing (GPT accuracy 0.53)
   - **Ablation**. Confirmed the impact of different stages and parameters on accuracy
   - **Improvement**. Compared to directly using LLM without retrieval, accuracy improved **0.22**; compared to the baseline implementation, improved **0.1**
3. API remains compatible

> **Note**: The impact of open-source on different fields/industries varies. We can only provide code implementation and test conclusions, and the test data cannot be provided.
